# Lokui Design

This document serves two purposes. To analyze existing UI frameworks for the purpose of learning from them, and then to design one that takes advantage of what is found to work well while avoiding the drawbacks. The end goal is not to have the design of Lokui completely fleshed out, but enough that everyone is on the same page of what working with it will be like.

## Existing frameworks

This may also include frameworks in other languages if they provide useful insights. Below is an example of a fictional framework to illustrate what each one should look like.

### Mug

Pros:

- The feature of reading one's mind to determine what the GUI should look like is extremely convenient and increases productivity dramatically. Here's a link to a demonstration of this.
- It is very customizable. Here's an example of how.

Cons:

- Mind-reading is rather intrusive.
- It refuses to display the number 27 for some reason. Here's an example of this happening.

## Conclusion

Here, we will document our learnings from the section above after we have gone through all the frameworks we want to, and what we want to take with us when designing Lokui.

## Lokui

Here, we will actually design Lokui, with code samples where relevant. This will probably change while we're implementing it, but it is a good start.
